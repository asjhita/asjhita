Hello, my account name is @asjhita.
I'm a student in the United Kingdom and I am trying to master frontend and backend developing
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, SQL and Python.
I'm excited to learn more and share my knowledge with others.
I am also interested in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
I'm looking forward to collaborating with others and learning from their experiences.
Feel free to reach out to me if you need any help or just want to chat about coding!
So far, I have started 1 project; Worldwide News!
At the moment, I am working on a digital book about how to program.
I will try to respond as quick as possible if somebody contacts me.
If you need help, I am always here!
Please don't ask for any personal info as I will NOT share any. (I'm sure you understand)

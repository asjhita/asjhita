# @asjhita
Hello, my account name is @asjhita. <br>
I'm a student in the United Kingdom and I am trying to master frontend and backend developing.<br>
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, SQL and Python.<br>
I'm excited to learn more and share my knowledge with others.<br>
I am also interested in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.<br>
I'm looking forward to collaborating with others and learning from their experiences.<br>
Feel free to reach out to me if you need any help or just want to chat about coding!<br>
So far, I have started 2 projects. Sent Unlimitext and Coding In A Nutshell.<br>
At the moment, I am working on a digital book about how to program.<br>
I will try to respond as quick as possible if somebody contacts me.<br>
If you need help, I am always here!<br>
Please don't ask for any personal info as I will NOT share any. (I'm sure you understand)

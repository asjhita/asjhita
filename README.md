## üåê Open-Source Contributions

I'm a big believer in the power of open-source. Here are some of the projects I've contributed to:

- **https://github.com/cosmicpython/book** - I helped to make it look more sleek as sending the fixed code. I will not be found in the contributors list though
- **https://github.com/electron/electron** - I mean, I didn't contribute to it but I highly reccomend it.

## üß© Developer Philosophy

As a developer, I value:

- **Simplicity**: Clear code is better than clever code. If someone else (or future me) can't understand it, it's not done right.
- **Reliability**: I aim to build systems and tools that are robust and dependable, especially under heavy load.
- **Learning & Sharing**: Knowledge is power, and I believe in passing it on. Whether through blog posts, tutorials, or open-source contributions, I strive to give back to the community.

## üåü GitHub Stats

## ‚ö° Fun Facts

- **Operating System**: Arch Linux - because I like my OS simple, efficient, and customizable.
- **Preferred Editor**: Vim - because once you go Vim, there‚Äôs no turning back.
- **Hobbies**: In my spare time, I enjoy coding (obviously), studying (not that much... not really at all) but that's all I do.
